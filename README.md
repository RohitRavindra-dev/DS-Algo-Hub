# DS-Algo-Hub: DSA Toolbox & Playground

Welcome to your personal Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA) toolbox! This repository is organized to help you learn, practice, and master DSA concepts in a structured, pattern-wise manner.

## 📁 Structure

- **Pattern/Topic Directories** (e.g., `arrays-and-hashing`, `linked-list`, `dp`, `graphs`, etc.)
  - Each topic contains subdirectories for individual problems.
    - Each problem directory contains:
      - `problem-statement.md` – The problem description
      - `solution.py` – Python solution (runnable)
      - `Solution.java` – Java solution (runnable)
      - `solutionLogic.txt` – Core idea, approaches, and pseudocode

## 🚀 Usage

- **Python:**
  - Open any `solution.py` and run it directly in your editor or terminal.
- **Java:**
  - Open the desired `Solution.java` file.
  - Press `Ctrl+Shift+B` (or select "Run Build Task...") to compile and run it automatically.

## 📊 Quick Lookup

- An Excel sheet at the root lists all problems, their topics, and a brief summary for quick interview prep and revision.

## 📝 Contributing/Adding Problems

1. Create a new subdirectory under the relevant topic.
2. Add the four files as described above.
3. Update the Excel sheet with the new problem and summary.

## 🧹 Housekeeping

- `.class` files and other build artifacts are ignored via `.gitignore`.
- Keep `solutionLogic.txt` concise and clear for future reference.

Happy learning and coding! 🚀
